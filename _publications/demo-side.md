This paper presents our work on developing a ***force-based learning framework*** for manipulating objects in force space. Our method decouples the robot from the object, simplifying the action space and reducing unnecessary exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a diverse set of objects in simulation and a real robotic platform.
