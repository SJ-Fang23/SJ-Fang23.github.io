In this paper, we explore the use of a ***progress***, a novel signal as a teaching tool for enhancing robots' learning from humans. Through two online studies and one public space study with non-expert participants, we validate that *progress* effectively reflects task performance, identifies unproductive behaviors, and requires no additional workload. Additionally, we contribute a dataset of sub-optimal, multi-policy demonstrations from a public ice cream-topping task.
