Enhancing the expressiveness of human teaching is
vital for both improving robotsâ€™ learning from humans and the
human-teaching-robot experience. In this work, we characterize
and test a little-used teaching signal: progress, designed to represent the completion percentage of a task. We conducted two
online studies with 76 crowd-sourced participants and one public space study with 40 non-expert participants to validate the
capability of this progress signal. We find that progress indicates
whether the task is successfully performed, reflects the degree
of task completion, identifies unproductive but harmless behaviors, and is likely to be more consistent across participants.
Furthermore, our results show that giving progress does not
require extra workload and time. An additional contribution
of our work is a dataset of 40 non-expert demonstrations from
the public space study through an ice cream topping-adding
task, which we observe to be multi-policy and sub-optimal,
with sub-optimality not only from teleoperation errors but also
from exploratory actions and attempts
