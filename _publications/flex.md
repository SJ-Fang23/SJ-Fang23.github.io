Prior work in learning from demonstration (LfD) often treats sub-optimal human behaviors as random noise. We show ***these suboptimal behaviors are systematic***, forming five types of sidetracks: *Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause, and One-dimension control*. Using a public study dataset, we found sidetracks are frequent and linked to task progression and control interfaces, highlighting the need for better models of non-expert behavior to improve LfD algorithms.
