**Hello and welcome!**

 I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) at Tufts University, where I’ll be graduating in May 2025. Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate degree in Robotic Engineering at Peking University. As I look toward the future, I’m actively seeking a Ph.D. position for 2025 to continue exploring the exciting world of robotics and deepen my research pursuits. Thanks for visiting!
