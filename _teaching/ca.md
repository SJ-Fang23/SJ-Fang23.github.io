In fall Tufts online graduate course [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/138/)

This course is a general introductory course on reinforcement learning, covering multi-arm bandit problems to deep reinforcement learning. I am in charge of holding office hours and grading programming assignments. This is a great experience to reinforce my knowledge of RL!
